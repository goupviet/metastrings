software:
handle errors specially
	add an error logs table, just for errors
	hook it up to the page that uses BLogEntries
		a fork in the flow of control: you either want logs or errors, not both
get unit tests to pass
get website to build

web sites:
BB4: "Powered by metastrings" 
	Add link to page footer
	Point this link to the old programmers page from BB2
	Link metastrings to BB's programmer's page as POC

deployment;
create BB3 -> BB2 data transfer program...again
use staging site to compare things side by side on the server
fire up the other web server, patch it, then deploy to it
	keep it out of the LB, but it will be production-like

web sites:
metastrings: Improve documentation
	go into details of the Command class
	describe what's typical, give examples

post to linkedin: metastrings powers POC web site Balogna Beats
