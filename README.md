metastrings is a NoSQL database.  

It is a .NET Core solution, soon to be .NET 5, so you can run it on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

The solution includes libraries for database clients, and programs for adding and querying data.

I invite brutal criticism, and substantial contributions.  

I'm new to git, and this is my first open source project, so please play nice and don't assume much.

Visit https://www.metastrings.io for detailed documentation.  Enjoy.
